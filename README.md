#Change Log
Version 1.0

-Initial upload

Version 2.0

-Updated the library to version 2.0
-I added in a method to set the value of the counter
-I also updated the functionally of the timer task to decrease the period between repeats. This allows the long press action to slowly in/decrement the count at first and then speed up to a more rapid pace

Version 2.1

-Updated the code to return the actual value of the counter in getValue()
-Added the ability to click the edit text view and enter a numeric value
